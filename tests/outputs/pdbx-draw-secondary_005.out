This program MUST read a single PDBx/mmCIF format file, SHOULD depict a specified part of the chain
as a wireframe model, color atoms by their chemical types and highlight the hydrogen bonds in secondary structures. 
Output MUST produce PNG or PNM format image file.
 
FORMATS: 
	INPUT file type: mmCIF/PDBx 
	OUTPUT file type: PNG or PNM
 
PROGRAM EXECUTION: 
	pdbx-draw-secondary [SELECTION STATEMENT] [INPUT FILE] [OUTPUT FILE] 
 	pdbx-draw-secondary [ROTATION OPTION] [ROTATION FILE] [SELECTION STATEMENT] [INPUT FILE] [OUTPUT FILE]
