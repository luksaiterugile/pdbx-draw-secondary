Image generation from protein structures
========================================

PROGRAM
=======
Write a Shell script which generates PNG format image file from a 
single protein structure PDBX/mmCIF[1] format file. 
Program uses here-document[2] code block which redirects stdin into Jmol[3] program. 
Program MUST:
-- depict a specified part of the chain as wireframe model;
-- color atoms by their chemical types;
-- highlight the hydrogen bonds in the secondary structures.

The title of the program:
pdbx-draw-secondary

Program execution:
pdbx-draw-secondary [selection statement] [input file] [output file]
or:
pdbx-draw-secondary [-r option] [rotation file] [selection statement] [input file] [output file]
or:
pdbx-draw-secondary [-h (--help) option]
or
pdbx-draw-secondary [-v (--version) option]

The first three position (i.e. non-option) arguments are required:
-- the first argument is a selection statement that describes the part
   of the chain to be displayed;
-- the second argument is the name of the input PDBx/mmCIF file;
-- the third argument is the name of the output PNG file.

Alternatively, when rotation option is used, it MUST be provided as a first argument, 
where second argument MUST be a rotation file. Selection statement, 
input file and output file MUST be provided after it. 

Information about options:
-- Help options are '-h' or '--help'. Program MUST print information in stdout.
-- Version options are '-v' or '--version'. Program MUST print Subversion[4] Id and program's version.
-- Rotation options are '-r' or '--rotation'. This option MUST be provided together with rotation file.
This file with rotation option determines the ultimate model orientation in the picture. 
The orientation setting commands MUST be applied to the selected atoms 
before they are rendered in the output picture.

Program execution examples:
pdbx-draw-secondary '288-317 and *:A and helix' 2C2A.cif 2C2A.png 

pdbx-draw-secondary -r rotation.ras '288-317 and *:A and helix' 2C2A.cif 2C2A.png

pdbx-draw-secondary -h

pdbx-draw-secondary -v

FILE FORMATS
============
The 'pdbx-draw-secondary' MUST accept the following files:
-- protein atom coordinate input file: PDBx;
-- rotation matrix format: Rasmol or Jmol commands;
-- selection of the atoms: Rasmol or Jmol selection statement;
-- image output format: PNG or PNM.

DIAGNOSTICS
===========
Program MUST raise an error about the following problems:
-- incorrect -r (--rotation) option usage;
-- unknown option usage;
-- incorrect number of elements in stdin;
-- input file is unreadable;
-- input file does not exist;
-- input file is not PDBx/mmCIF format file;
-- input file is not ASCII text format file;
-- output file is not PNG format file; 
-- incorrect input Jmol commands syntax used in selection
statement or in rotation file;
-- situations when the image cannot be created;

Error format - error message MUST print program's name, file name if the problem was 
caused by it, message explaining the problem and citation of the command if the problem was caused by incorrect input command syntax.
